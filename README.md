# leet-code
Many of us are familiar with Leet Code - an online web platform that tests users with algorithmic coding problems. It is good practice for developers of all levels of experience and I often find that the certain solutions can be helpfully applied to real world solutions. The primary purpose of this repo, is to allow me to organize my solutions and easily access them from anywhere using GitHub for reference.
